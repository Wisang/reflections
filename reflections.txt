How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It helps me go back to the previously working version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: can reflect my intention
Cons: may become a too big commit if I don't commit frequently enough.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

To make a meaningful suite of changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can see all the history of my file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can go back to the last working version at any time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Version Control, of course.
